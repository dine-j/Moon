**Welcome!**

I graduated from King's College London with a MSci in Computer Science last summer. My degree mostly involved Programming, Articial Intelligence and Security. I like coding and the proud feeling you get when you solved a problem and can ship it with a piece of efficient, good-written code!

I also have some background in Business Administration (Master in Marketing done in an exchange programme) that gave me good-to-have soft skills: organising, planning, and I'm also a good listener!

Learning new technologies and languages doesn't scare me. I consider myself a backend developer, but I'm always up for new challenges.

**Current status:** Open to full-time opportunities in London, either in Java, Python or C++ in a mid-size company. I'm also very product-oriented, so the product needs to appeal to me before anything else.
