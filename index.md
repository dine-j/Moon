**Welcome!**

I am on my way to finish my fourth year at King's College London. I'm currently studying Computer Science and enjoying it. I took all AI modules that I could, and I took some Security modules as well.

I had a change in my studies and while I think I picked up some nice skills doing Marketing and Human Resources, I can't deny my passion for technology and the proud feeling you get when you produce a piece of efficient, good-written code.

Learning new technologies and languages doesn't scare me. Studying far from home and studying abroad turned me into a curious and adaptive person.
